# Inbank_Data_Engineering_Internship_Test
Hi, my name is Hai. Thank you again for this opportunity, I appreciate it!

My solutions for Data Engineering Internship test including two parts which I have attached 2 files in the main branch. Besides, you can easily find some hands-on projects that I completed in my GitHub, which I utilized tech stacks: AWS, Airflow, Tableau, Programming languages (SQL, Python) and ETL solutions.

To contribute my abilities as well as to learn from each other simultaneously, I am looking forward to discuss further this opportunity in Inbank.

Thank you in advance,

Best regards,

Hai
